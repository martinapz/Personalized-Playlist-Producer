# Personalized-Playlist-Producer

This project utilizes different datasets in Spotify in order to create a personalized
playlist for each user. It is a website in which the user can choose a specific genre,
artist, song, and/or year, and choose how long they would like the playlist to be. Based
on this personalized list, the application makes a list of songs for your use.
This app also includes themes where users can choose what they want to make the playlist for. 
If someone is having a birthday party or trying to make a playlist for Valentine’s Day, they can 
simply check those boxes and the application will query through the data for the word “birthday” or “love” in 
order to fit the theme. Another feature we this app includes is the ability for users to add their friends to 
access the playlist they have made. Finally, there is a general info page that includes information 
about top songs, artists, and more.
