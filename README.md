# Personalized-Playlist-Producer

This project will utilizes different datasets in Spotify in order to create a personalized
playlist for each user. It is a website in which the user can choose a specific genre,
artist, song, and/or year, and choose how long they would like the playlist to be. Based
on this personalized list, the application will make a list of songs for your use.
In addition to these requirements, we would have themes where people could choose
what they want to make the playlist for. If someone is having a birthday party or trying to
make a playlist for Valentine’s Day, they can simply check those boxes and the
application will query through the data for the word “birthday” or “love” in order to fit the
theme. Another feature we this app includes is the ability for users to add their friends to 
access the playlist they have made. Finally, there is a general info page that includes information 
about top songs, artists, and more.
