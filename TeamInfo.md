
## Project Summary

Our project will be utilizing different datasets in Spotify in order to create a personalized playlist for each user. It will be a website in which the user can choose a specific genre, artist, song, and/or year, and choose how long they would like the playlist to be. Based on this personalized list, the application will make a list of songs for your use. 

In addition to these requirements, we would have themes where people could choose what they want to make the playlist for. If someone is having a birthday party or trying to make a playlist for Valentine’s Day, they can simply check those boxes and the application will query through the data for the word “birthday” or “love” in order to fit the theme. Another complex feature we would like to add is the idea of personalizing each new playlist to your friends interests. The user can input a friend and choose artists and genres their specific friend likes. The application can then save the friends information for a later date and when creating a playlist for events that specific people will come to, the user can simply click their friends name on the box to specify their preferences as well. There would also be an option to input songs of choice in case the user would like a specific song to be added to this playlist.
